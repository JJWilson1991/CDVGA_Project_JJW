Load the required libraries 



```{r}

library(readxl)

library(dplyr)

library(tidyverse)

library(forcats)

library(ggthemes)

library(plotly)

library(knitr)

library(naniar)



```



Load the processed data from the RDS



```{r}

CDV_Clean <- readRDS("../../data/processed_data/CDVprocesseddata.rds")



glimpse(CDV_Clean)

```
```{r}
#The data we are most interested in is the Species data over time and the area data over time so we'll begin by exploring these

ggplot(CDV_Clean, aes(Species, fill=Species, color=Species)) +geom_bar()

#we can see that Raccoon and Gray fox are hugely over represented compared to the others so we should focus our analysis on these two species
```
```{r}
SPperYr <- with(CDV_Clean, table(subset(CDV_Clean, Species == c("Raccoon", "Gray Fox"))), CollectionYear)
ggplot(as.data.frame(SPperYr), aes(CollectionYear, Freq, fill = Species, color = Species, group = Species))  + geom_point() +geom_line()

#looking overtime there appears to be some patterns in the number of postive cases, with definite peaks possibly relating to epidemics of CDV
#It also looks like there may be a delay in the Gray Fox peak following the peak in Raccoons, this is worth looking into
```

```{r}
ggplot(CDV_Clean, aes(State, fill=State, color=State)) +geom_bar()

#GA is the majority of cases which is understanabdle as SCWDS is in Athens, but bthere are enough cases in other south eastern states to possibly gain some insight
#but i think the bulk of the mapping should focus on the county datat within GA

```
```{r}
StperYr <- with(CDV_Clean, table(State, CollectionYear))
ggplot(as.data.frame(StperYr), aes(CollectionYear, Freq, fill = State, color = State, group = State))  + geom_point() +geom_line()

#the cases per state over time seem to foloow a similar pattern but it may be worth plotting species cases per state and mapping location, maybe certain species are more affected in different states at different times?


```

```{r}
RGFAge <- subset(CDV_Clean, Species == c("Raccoon", "Gray Fox") & Age == c("Adult", "Subadult", "Juvenile"))
ggplot(RGFAge, aes(Species, color=Species)) +geom_bar(aes(fill = Age))
```
